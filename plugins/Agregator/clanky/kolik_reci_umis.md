Pokud čtete některé mé příspěvky do různých web stránek, tak jste se asi povšimli, že v mnoha případech používám cizí, většinou odborné výrazy.

Na těch 200 nebo možná již 300 odborných a hotelových školách se dnes angličtina již učí, takže za několik let bude každý restaurační či hotelový zaměstnanec mluvit anglicky jako když bičem mrská, ale hosté budou po nějaký čas ještě handicapováni.

Přikládám vám něco pro pobavení. Je to v angličtině protože do češtiny se to přeložit nedá, ztratilo by to totiž také na snaze poukázat na to, jak je v pohostinství znalost angličtiny důležitá jak u zaměstnanců tak i u hostů.

Here are some signs and notices written in English that were discovered throughout the world.
